CUDA Rasterizer
===============

[CLICK ME FOR INSTRUCTION OF THIS PROJECT](./INSTRUCTION.md)

**University of Pennsylvania, CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture, Project 4**

* (TODO) YOUR NAME HERE
	* (TODO) [LinkedIn](), [personal website](), [twitter](), etc.
* Tested on: (TODO) Windows 22, i7-2222 @ 2.22GHz 22GB, GTX 222 222MB (Moore 2222 Lab)

### (TODO: Your README)

*DO NOT* leave the README to the last minute! It is a crucial part of the
project, and we will not be able to grade you without a good README.

- performance test
    - size of tiles
    - 2 ways of tile-based rasterization vs normal of different primitives at different distances
