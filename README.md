# Project Goal

</p>


In this project, I implemented a Path Tracer using the CUDA parallel computing platform. Path Tracing is a computer graphics Monte Carlo method of rendering images of three-dimensional scenes such that the global illumination is faithful to reality.

# Rasterizer Intro
<p align="center">

</p>
Rasterization is a fast rendering technique used in computer graphics. In simple terms, after loading in a model in memory, we identify triangles that constitute the geometry, and then test the intersection of screen pixels with these triangles. In the end, we render the closest intersected pixels. The image above showcases which pixels are considered intersected with the loaded triangle.

This project implements a full rasterization pipeline with GLTF assets support:
1. Load in GLTF asset into memory
2. Transform the vertices from model space to pixel space using camera projection
3. Assemble transformed vertices into packages (normals, colors, textures, etc..) with triangulation
4. Perform triangle/pixel intersection (rasterization)
5. Color identified fragments
6. Send the buffer of colored fragments to the display

## Extra Features
### Supersampling - Anti-Aliasing
| Without SSAA | With SSAA | 
| ------------- | ----------- |
| ![](imgs/no_aa.png) | ![](imgs/aa.png) |

Supersampling is type of anti-aliasing in which we render the image at a higher resolution (say 4x), then we downsample the final output. This means that if for each final pixel we supersampled 4 other pixels, then the final color of the pixel is the average of those 4. This diminishes issues with stair-step like lines that should be smooth instead. Performance-wise, adding SSAA x4 means that you will be doing x4 amounts of work since your buffer is that much bigger. Everything else stays the same in terms of code structure, it really is just working with bigger buffers.

### Perspective Correct Color
| Without Correct Interp | With Correct Interp | 
| ------------- | ----------- |
| ![](imgs/incorr_col.png) | ![](imgs/corr_col.png) |

Linear interpolation of vertex attributes generally leads to wrong results (colors, normals, texture coordinates) because the geometry is distorted in the world and depth should be taken into account. Applying perspective correct interpolation does that (incorporates the z-value into the calculation) such that the values are interpolated correctly. Performance-wise, this has no impact at all since we are just doing 4 extra floating point computation for the interpolation (dividing by z-values).

### Texture Mapping with Bilinear Filtering
| Without Correct Interp | With Correct Interp |  With Bilinear Filtering | 
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| ![](imgs/incorr_tex.png) | ![](imgs/corr_tex.png) | ![](imgs/bilinear.png) |

Both images above show texture importing onto a quad. The one on the left shows incorrect interpolation of texture coordinates for the same reason as described above. The middle one shows the correct version. The right version shows a tweaked sampling model called bilinear filtering, which smoothes out displayed textures when they are larger or smaller than stored in memory. Performance-wise, bilinear filtering requires 3 additional global memory reads, which slows down the overall texturing pipeline.

## Performance in the Pipeline

</p>
Performance varied from scene to scene. For scenes with a large number of triangles, rasterization took the most amount of time because of the large amount of checks done in that stage. Framebuffer copying is the same in all stages (since it is the same operation, independent of scene size). Fragment shading was also almost the same, with the exception of the flower scene that did lambert shading instead of texture mapping, and finally vertex assembly was fast in all cases due to low branching (and the fact that we do it per vertex)
