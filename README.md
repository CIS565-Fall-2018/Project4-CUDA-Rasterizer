## Features

### Texturing

#### Bilinear Texture Filtering  
  
Since vertices are given specific UV coordinates on the texture in floating point values normalized 0 to 1, there are bound to be issues with texture scaling and aliasing effects. Bilinear filtering blurs the target texel with its neighbors, smoothing the drawn texture, using linear interpolation. The coefficient used for interpolating in this case is the difference between the integer and float values of the texel index. The code design was actually based off the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_filtering) and handles edge cases by wrapping the texture.
  
#### Perspective-Correct Texture Mapping
  
If you only compute the fragment attributes using the original vertex attributes and barycentric weights, you get "alline" interpolation. The problem with this method is most clearly seen in textures when perspective is used, and results in the texturing of neighboring triangles appearing "disjoint" with one another. To fix this, a perspective adjustment was applied by calculating the depth "w" and multiplting each contribution by this factor divided by the vertex z position for that attribute. In code:  
  
```cpp
// "bary" is the barycentric weights, and "tri" stores the vertex positions
float w = 1.0f / ((bary.x / tri[0].z) + (bary.y / tri[1].z) + (bary.z / tri[2].z));

fragBuf[f_idx].texcoord0 = w * (  (p.v[0].texcoord0 * bary.x / tri[0].z) 
                                 + (p.v[1].texcoord0 * bary.y / tri[1].z) 
                                 + (p.v[2].texcoord0 * bary.z / tri[2].z));
```
  
The result is reduced unwanted distortion on attributes due to distortion (the same formula can be used on normals, colors, etc). A comparison between affine (first image) and corrected (second image) textering is seen below for a checkerboard texture:

The second image also has bilinear filtering. While the pattern does not look perfect, probably due to rounding errors, it is singnificantly improved from the affine case.
